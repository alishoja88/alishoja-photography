              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                When I first got my hands on a digital device that allowed me to
                take photos, I was about 24 years old. At the time, due to my
                work, I had to travel to different cities across Iran.
                Gradually, I started taking pictures and capturing moments.
                Initially, it was just a way to explore my tablet, but soon, I
                realized something deeperâ€”photography made me pause. It made me
                stop and truly look at the world around me: the people, nature,
                and life unfolding in front of me. I became aware of how
                fleeting time is, how quickly everything passes by.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                As time went on, I discovered that photography was more than
                just taking pictures; it was a tool that helped me focus on my
                surroundings. That realization led me to buy a smartphone with a
                good camera, and at that time, the iPhone 6s was a great choice.
                From that moment on, capturing street life, people, and nature
                became the most enjoyable thing I had ever done.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Now, I see the world as if it's framed within a lens. Every time
                I look at something, I unconsciously compose it as a picture.
                When I gaze at the moon, I observe it in relation to its
                surroundings. Everything I see naturally fits into a frame in my
                mind.
